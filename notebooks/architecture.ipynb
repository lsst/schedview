    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `schedview` module organizes code used to create scheduler visualizations into four submodules corresponding to different stages in transforming the data from a raw reference to a source into a useful visualization.\n",
    "These four stages are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - collection, which obtains the data from whatever resources are required;\n",
    " - computation, which transforms the data into values to be directly represented in the visualizatios;\n",
    " - plotting, which generates visualization objects; and\n",
    " - dashboard generation, which collects and displays visualizations in a web application\n",
    " \n",
    "This notebook walks through the process of creating a visualization, one stage at a time, using an example chosen to demonstrate the principles underlying the chosen architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we build a dashboard that shows the locations of minor planets (in equatorial coordinates) over a period of time.\n",
    "This application is outside the scope of the content intended to included in `schedview`, which only packages scheduler and progress related visualizations.\n",
    "`schedview`'s basic architecture, however, is applicable beyond its scope.\n",
    "This example was chosen because it is an application to real-world data that is complex enough to demonstrate all aspects of the architecture, and can be implemented in this architecture with a minimum of additional application-specific complexities that would distract from them."
