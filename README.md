# schedview
The `schedview` module provides tools for visualizing Rubin Observatory scheduler behaviour and Rubin Observatory/LSST survey status, including:

- A collection of functions, eacho of which creates an independent visualization of some aspect of scheduler behaviour, state, or surve progress. These functions may be used in `jupyter` notebooks or other python applications, or combined into dashboards or other higher level applications.
- A handful of dashboard applications that collect relevant visualizations into sets suitable for specific use cases.
