Tools for visualizing Rubin Observatory scheduler behaviour and LSST survey status

There are presently two different applications in this project:

- `sched_maps`, a tool for examing some elements of the state of objects used
  by the scheduler, particularly those that take the form of a sky map,
  although some indications of other elements are also present.
- `prenight`, a pre-night briefing dashboard.
